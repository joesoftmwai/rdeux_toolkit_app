## Project setup 

After cloning the project, run:

```
npm install
```

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm start
```

## Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!
